    <p2><center>Overthrew her drunk ass husband to reign in her own right. <br />
        Had 22 lovers, 2 of whom were brothers who killed her husband/Emperor for her.<br />
        Liked her men like she liked her diamonds.  Dripping all over her. (Sorry for being so X rated Kiddos)</center>
              <br /><center>(And No Catherine the Great didn't die by fornicating with a horse,
          but her lover, 40 years younger than her might have been built like one. ;) That's me winking at you.)</center></p2>

              <p2><center>When her husband King Edward II started treating his male lover better than Isabella and took her children from her,
                 she took his mortal enemy as a lover and made love all through France. <br /> She then deposed Edward, had him killed, and put
                  her son on the throne. <br /> (She was actually an English Queen by marriage but French princess by birth.
                  Her moniker <q>She-Wolf of France</q> refers to her heritage not marriage.
                  Yeah we know it gets confusing like this sometimes.)</center></p2>

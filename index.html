<h1>Sexually Liberated Women Rulers in History</h1><br />
<h3>Act like a Queen and have lots of sex</h3>
<h4>This page in response to the scores of people that slut shame women and who also think women enjoying sex, taking male and female lovers, and getting rid of their husbands are new phenomenons.</h4>
<br />
<h2><q>I believe in money, power, and respect/ First you get the money/ Then you get the motherf***ing, power / After you get the f***ing power, motherf***ers will respect you</q> -Empress Catherine the Great describing her life, probably.</h2>

  <p><b>Empress Catherine the Great of Russia</b></p>
  <p>Leemage/Corbis/Getty Images</p>
    <p2><center>Overthrew her drunk ass husband to reign in her own right. <br />
        Had 22 lovers, 2 of whom were brothers who killed her husband/Emperor for her.<br />
        Never remarried after the death of her husband so she could retain power, but did have children by her lovers. <br />
        Men lined up to be her lover up until her death at 67. Her lovers were often in their 20s. <br />
        Catherine rewarded her lovers with lots of money, land, positions of power, and one she made a King of Poland. <br />
        Liked her men like she liked her diamonds.  Dripping all over her. (Sorry for being so X rated Kiddos)</center>
              <br /><center>(And No Catherine the Great didn't die by fornicating with a horse,
          but her lover, 40 years younger than her might have been built like one. ;) That's me winking at you.)</center></p2>

      <p><b>Queen Isabella the <q>She-Wolf</q> of France</b></p>
              <p2><center>When her husband King Edward II started treating his male lover better than Isabella and took her children from her,
                 she took his mortal enemy as a lover and made love all through France. <br /> She then deposed Edward, had him killed, and put
                  her son on the throne. <br /> (She was actually an English Queen by marriage but French princess by birth.
                  Her moniker <q>She-Wolf of France</q> refers to her heritage not marriage.
                  Yeah we know it gets confusing like this sometimes.) <br />

                      So instead she took his siblings as her lovers.  His sister Sophie von Fersen and his brother<br />
                      Fabian von Fersen. Her husband had many lovers, and also took a Von Fersen (Augusta), niece to the siblings father. <br />
                    She preferred that her husband have and keep plenty of mistresses so she could do as she pleased.

                      <p2><center>This was a very well known Swedish family and they had A LOT OF SEX<br />
                        A lot of that sex was with Queens, Kings, Princes, Dutchesses and a whole host of other people <br />
                        Axel von Fersen Jr. is the most well known in the U.S because of his affair with Queen Marie-Antionette, so most English information is on him.<br />
                        Just with our last 2 Queens, Axel had affairs with both of them.  Augusta Von Fersen, his niece had an affair with the husband of Queen Hedvig, Charles/Carl XIII of Sweden and Norway.<br />
                        His other niece Ulrika von Fersen had an affair with Prince Fredrick Adolf of Sweden, King Charles/Carl's brother. <br />
                        Ulrika also had an affair with her cousin Sophie von Fersen's husband. (Again Sophie was also a lover to Queen Hedvig Charlotte)<br />
